check eq 63-66 in the paper (ref 3 ) for comp w. mean field result. 

realistic fano dactor : (lower than 60)
 three proteins: higher than one
 in the range 1-100

 the important thing is the comparison between the numbers. 

 task 4: 

 check at least 20

 can be challenging to get optimized. 

 

 check av. nr of mrna in task 3 by  checking dndt = 0
 N\_av = kp/kd

 run with whatever rate you want. L did with 2 




\section{2nd lab}
epigenetics
above genetics. 

wrapped around histones that can turn on or off genes. 

this state is captured in the cell division, (inherited)

bit more math heavy

acythelated and methylated affect eachother 



last task: pretty small variation, protein current J around .5
